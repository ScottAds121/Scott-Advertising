        <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">Welcome to Scott Advertising! I am a long-time resident of Chicago area, with over 25 years of experience living and working in the Chicagoland area. As a full-time engineering professional with a background in problem-solving and analytics, I have applied my skills to develop a passion for digital and social media advertising. Over the past year, I have honed my expertise by working on various side projects that have allowed me to understand the intricacies of local marketing strategies.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">My mission is clear: to help small and local businesses thrive by providing affordable and impactful digital advertising solutions. In a world where corporations dominate, I believe local businesses deserve the same level of exposure and opportunities. That's why I am offering two weeks of free, no-commitment advertising services to businesses that want to increase their visibility and attract more customers. During this trial period, I will handle everything from setting up targeted social media ad campaigns to optimizing them for maximum results.</font></p>
	<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">At the end of the two weeks, we will review the campaign performance together. If the campaign has successfully brought in more leads and customers, we can explore the next steps. If not, there is no obligation to continue, and you will not have invested a penny upfront. My approach is transparent and risk-free, with no hidden costs or requirements for a credit card during the trial.</font></p>
	<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">Even if you do not have ready marketing materials, I can utilize available online information to design a campaign that resonates with your target audience and promotes your services effectively. My goal is not to grow my wealth but to empower local businesses to compete and succeed in todays digital landscape.</font></p>
	<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">If you are ready to take the first step toward boosting your business, or simply want to learn more, feel free to reach out. I am here to help local businesses like yours grow and thrive with personalized, results-driven advertising.</font></p>
